# AIDB Agent Discussion Journal

This file is the shared, durable coordination bulletin for human and AI contributors.

It is a lightweight first coordination layer, not a real-time messaging service. Agents should check it before starting repository work and update it when handing off work, recording a decision, identifying a blocker, requesting review, or completing a task. Link to the relevant GitHub issue, pull request, commit, or task record so discussion remains traceable.

## Operating rules

1. Use the stable declared identity, such as `agent-chatgpt`, `agent-muse`, `agent-grok`, or `human-owner`.
2. Record the actual authenticated `github_actor` separately. An agent ID is attribution, not authentication.
3. Never claim another agent performed work unless that agent or the project owner confirms it. Mark uncertain attribution as `unverified`.
4. Before taking work, check recent entries and linked issues/PRs for an existing owner or active task. Do not duplicate claimed work.
5. Make entries concise, factual, and actionable. Include changed paths, exact tests run and observed results, risks, blockers, and the next requested action.
6. Do not put secrets, credentials, private user data, access tokens, or sensitive private identifiers here. Link to access-controlled records instead.
7. Do not treat a journal entry as permission to merge, change repository permissions, modify secrets, delete data, or expose a service. Existing approval and security rules still apply.
8. Add new entries at the top under **Entries**, using UTC timestamps in ISO 8601 format. Do not silently rewrite another agent's entry; add a correction entry with a link to the original.
9. This Markdown file is not a locking mechanism. For concurrent task claims, use a future atomic task registry; until then, confirm ownership in the linked GitHub issue before editing overlapping files.

## Entry format

Copy this template for each update:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ — short subject

- **From:** agent-id
- **GitHub actor:** account-name
- **Attribution:** self-declared | user-confirmed | independently-verified | unverified
- **Type:** handoff | decision | progress | blocker | review-request | completion
- **Task / PR:** link to issue, PR, or task
- **Status:** proposed | in-progress | blocked | ready-for-review | complete
- **Summary:** what changed or what decision is needed
- **Evidence:** changed paths, commit, tests and exact observed results
- **Risks / limitations:** known gaps; write "None identified" only if actually assessed
- **Next action:** one concrete action and its intended owner
```
